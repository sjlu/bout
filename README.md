## bout

All these trackers kind of suck in terms of social aspects. My friend has a Jawbone, I have the Withings tracker and my dad has a Fitbit. So the initial idea was to connect all of these trackers together in one place so we could all motivate each other in one form or another. Then it spawned out to become a game similar to Halo where two people fight against other teams. Sort of like Team Doubles but in a week long match. Teams and individuals obtain complete day challenges, week challenges and lifetime challenges in order to increase their team's multiplier.
